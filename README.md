# library


On this project I practiced working on objects. Creating them dynamicaly with constructors.

It's a simple library, where I implemented creating objects through form, whcih calls on the consturctor.

Then I displayed them with grid layout on the page.

So here I practiced creating objects, storing them in array and also chaning their properties with shared method

throguh the prototype.

Nothing crazy, but was a small challange to me, and it helped me understrand how objects work a bit better.

Also I got a grasp on how to use objects as well.
